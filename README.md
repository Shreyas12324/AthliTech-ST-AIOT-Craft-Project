This project consists of a collection of interactive sensor-based visualizers developed using Flask for the backend and p5.js for the frontend. The games utilize sensor data from a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) device (SensorTile Box Pro) and make use of the MLC model generated by ST AIOT Craft Platform to create engaging experiences.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Node.js (if using npm for JavaScript dependencies)

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the static folder:
   ```bash
   cd static
   ```

2. To install JavaScript dependencies, run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the Flask server:
   ```bash
   python conn_flask.py
   ```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:9000` to access the games.

3. Follow the on-screen instructions for each game.

## Game Descriptions

- **Bicep Curls**: Move the ball by curling your arms. The MLC provides predictions to indicate whether your form is good, standby, or bad.
- **Squat Counter**: Perform squats to increase the counter. The MLC predicts your position to help you maintain proper form.
- **Shoulder Press**: Press your arms up and down to move the ball. The MLC gives feedback on your form during the exercise.
- **Pushups**: Perform pushups to control the ball's movement. The MLC predicts your form to ensure you are doing the exercise correctly.
- **Plank**: Maintain a plank position to keep the ball steady. The MLC provides predictions to help you stay in the correct position.
- **Tricep Overhead**: Extend your arms overhead to move the ball. The MLC gives predictions to indicate your form during the exercise.

## Decsion Tree Model MLC Configuration Files

The MLC configuration files are generated by the AIOT Craft app and website, keeping the firmware as **Datalog 3.00**.These configurations are essential for the proper functioning of the MLC predictions.

### App Configuration Files
The app configuration file is generated in the BLE sensor app after changing the firmware to **Entry/Expert 1.21**. These configurations are essential for the proper functioning of the MLC predictions in the games.
They are required to flash the app inside the Ssensortile Box so that it can run locally.
